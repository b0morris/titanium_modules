Appcelerator Titanium Module for Flurry Analytics
=================================================

This is the Flurry Analytics Module for Titanium.  It will provide you
with access to Flurry integration in your Titanium iPhone application.

Application Initialization
---------------------------

Add the following to your tiapp.xml:

    <module version="1.0">ti.flurry</module>

To setup your app, you need to initialize the module with your 
Flurry application API key.  You should place this command in your 
app.js:

    var flurry = require("ti.flurry");
    flurry.initialize("YOUR_API_KEY");

Make sure you replace YOUR_API_KEY with your *actual* key.

That's it for the basics.  You should now receive Flurry analytics data.

Extra Stuff
------------

Custom Event Logging

To log events using custom events, you can call the following API:

    flurry.logEvent(event_name, parameters);

Where `event_name` is a string name of your event and where `parameters` (optional)
is a Javascript dictionary of key value pairs (JSON serializable) that you want to
associate with the event.


Timed Event Logging

Logging a timed event is the same as logging an untimed event, only you need to
manually notify Flurry when the event has ended.

    flurry.logTimedEvent(event_name, parameters);
    flurry.endTimedEvent(event_name, parameters);

The `parameters` argument is optional in both calls. If supplied in endTimedEvent(),
it will log the change in that parameter from the initial logTimedEvent() call.


Session Parameters

Flurry also allows you to associate a userId, age, and gender with a particular
session.

    flurry.setUserId(string);
    flurry.setAge(int);
    flurry.setGender(string); // m or f
